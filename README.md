## Installation

You need to install docker and docker-compose.

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Usage

Rename the .env.example file to .env and run
```bash
$ cd minecraft-server
$ docker-compose up -d
```

I took the image from here [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server), in the same place all the docs.
This repository is just an example using a minecraft server image.
